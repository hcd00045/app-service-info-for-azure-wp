Adds a Microsoft Azure App Service deployment identifier to the footer of the admin section. 

== Description ==
Microsoft's Azure App Service offers terrific tools to automatically deploy your application from your version control system to one or more App Service slots. This runs so transparently that sometimes it's difficult to know which version of your site you're looking at! This plugin retrieves information about the current App Service deployment and adds that information to the admin page footer.

Once enabled, simply hover over the App Service deployment identifier in the admin footer to see detailed information about the deployment.
